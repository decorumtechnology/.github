At one point, I assembled a small but sharp team of designers and developers and started Decorum Technology and Research Center (DTRC) - a software outfit that delivered custom applications for Nepal-based clients.
We built some solid products, a few of which are already out in the wild, serving real users.

But I eventually realized service businesses often end up as a juggling act between "what the client wants" and "what your team can manage by Friday", and honestly, it gets old fast. You spend your time translating vague client wishes into deadlines. It’s less engineering and more interpretive dance. So for me, that model ran its course.

DTRC has stepped away from the traditional service model but will delve into advanced research and innovative product development focused on the core foundations of computer science.

If we ever provide services again, it won’t be about spinning up dashboards or stitching together APIs. It will be deeply technical, the kind of service where people seek collaboration not just for execution, but for expertise built through solving complex, ***system-level*** problems.
